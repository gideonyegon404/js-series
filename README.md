# One Hour of JavaScript Series

Welcome to the "One Hour of JS" series repository!
This collection of resources was created with one goal in mind:
to help you master JavaScript in just one hour a day.

## Why was this repository created?

Learning JavaScript, whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, can be a rewarding journey. However, with the abundance of resources available, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. That's where this series comes in. We've carefully curated daily lessons to provide a structured, focused, and efficient learning path.

## How to navigate

Each day's session is organized into branches. To access the content for a specific day, simply switch to the corresponding branch. Explore a variety of topics, from the basics to more advanced concepts, and build your JavaScript skills progressively.

This repository is designed to be a companion to our "One Hour of JS" sessions. Join us for live sessions or use this repository as a self-paced learning resource.

Happy coding!
